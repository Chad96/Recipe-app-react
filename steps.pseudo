1. **Project Setup:**
   - Create a new React project using Vite.
   - Set up the project structure with essential directories (components, pages, services, etc.).
   - Install necessary dependencies including react-router-dom, axios (for API calls), and styled-components for styling.

2. **User Management:**
   - **Registration Page:**
     - Create a form with fields: Name, Surname, Email, Username, Profile Picture.
     - On form submission, validate the inputs.
     - If valid, encrypt the user's password using a hashing library.
     - Save user data to the JSON server using the `POST` method.
   
   - **Login Page:**
     - Create a login form with fields: Username and Password.
     - On form submission, validate the inputs.
     - Check the credentials against the stored encrypted data.
     - If valid, store the user's session data locally and navigate to the Home Page.
   
   - **Profile Page:**
     - Fetch the user's profile data from the JSON server.
     - Display the profile information.
     - Provide options to update profile information and login credentials.
     - On update, validate the inputs and send the updated data to the JSON server using the `PATCH/PUT` method.
   
   - **Authorization & Routing:**
     - Implement protected routes for pages accessible only to logged-in users (e.g., Home, Profile).
     - Redirect unauthenticated users to the Login Page.
     - Ensure logged-in users cannot access the Registration and Login pages.

3. **Recipe Management:**
   - **Home Page:**
     - Display a list of all recipes.
     - Fetch recipes from the JSON server using the `GET` method.
     - Provide options to view, edit, or delete a recipe.
   
   - **Add Recipe:**
     - Create a form with fields: Recipe Name, Ingredients, Instructions, Category, Preparation Time, Cooking Time, Servings.
     - On form submission, validate the inputs.
     - Send the new recipe data to the JSON server using the `POST` method.
     - Update the recipe list with the newly added recipe.

   - **Edit Recipe:**
     - Allow users to select a recipe to edit.
     - Prefill the form with the recipe's existing data.
     - On form submission, validate the inputs.
     - Send the updated recipe data to the JSON server using the `PATCH/PUT` method.

   - **Delete Recipe:**
     - Provide a delete button for each recipe.
     - On button click, prompt the user for confirmation.
     - If confirmed, send a `DELETE` request to the JSON server to remove the recipe.
     - Update the recipe list to reflect the removal.

   - **Search Functionality:**
     - Implement a search bar on the Home Page.
     - Allow users to search recipes by name or category.
     - Filter the displayed recipes based on the search query.

   - **Recipe Categories:**
     - Classify recipes into categories like Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, etc.
     - Allow users to filter recipes by category.

4. **Data Management:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - Use a JSON server as the primary data storage.
     - Ensure all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interact with the JSON server.
   
   - **Performance Optimization:**
     - Optimize the app for fast loading by minimizing API calls.
     - Implement lazy loading for components and images where applicable.

   - **Privacy & Security:**
     - Encrypt sensitive user data, especially login credentials.
     - Follow best practices for data protection and ensure compliance with relevant privacy laws.

5. **User Interface:**
   - Create a user-friendly interface that is responsive across different screen sizes.
   - Use styled-components for consistent styling.
   - Ensure intuitive navigation with clear labels and buttons.
   - Add hover effects and transitions for better interactivity.

6. **Code Quality:**
   - Break down logic into smaller functions to enhance readability.
   - Use self-explanatory variable names and follow camelCasing conventions.
   - Reuse components where possible to avoid code duplication.
   - Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

7. **Responsiveness:**
   - Ensure the app is responsive at common breakpoints (320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1200px).
   - Test the app on different devices to ensure consistent behavior.

8. **Final Steps:**
   - Commit your changes frequently to the GitHub repository.
   - Document your project in the README file, including setup instructions and features.
   - Push the final version to the main branch and share the GitHub link on Slack with your mentor.
